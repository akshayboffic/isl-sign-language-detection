# isl-sign-language-detection
This project is a real-time ISL detection system using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and a machine learning model. It recognizes six ISL words: Hello, Yes, No, Thanks, Please, and I love you. Streamlit provides an interactive GUI that displays webcam input, highlights hand landmarks, and overlays predictions with confidence scores.
